      <h1>About RuralRounds</h1>
      <p>
        RuralRounds was built by two sisters — one works as a rural nurse in Minnesota, the other as a critical care provider who lives in spreadsheets and ICU alarms.
        We’ve both seen just how hard rural healthcare can be. It’s gritty, isolated, and full of moments where you think, <em>“Why does no one talk about this stuff?”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is our answer to that question. A place to be real, to connect, and to share tools that actually make sense in the real world — the world where you might be the only one on call, where backup is two hours away, and where you're making do with what you have.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're not here to sell you anything or make things sound prettier than they are. We're here to make things better — one story, one resource, one connection at a time.
      </p>

      <h2>What you'll find here:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stories</strong> — the kind you won't find in journals</li>
        <li><strong>Tools</strong> — built with low-resources in mind</li>
        <li><strong>Community</strong> — or at least the start of one</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you're working in rural healthcare, this space is yours. Pull up a chair. Drop us a story. Ask a hard question. Or just poke around and know you're not alone out there.
      </p>

      <p><em>We’re glad you’re here. And we’re just getting started.</em></p>
