      <h1>🔥 The FIRE Framework</h1>
      <p>
        The FIRE Framework is a lightweight, practical approach to surfacing and solving problems in rural healthcare settings. Designed for teams with limited time and resources, FIRE empowers frontline staff to take initiative and improve systems that affect their work every day.
      </p>
      <p><strong>FIRE stands for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find</strong> – Spot the issue or opportunity during your normal workday.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify</strong> – Get specific: What’s the root problem? Who’s affected? When and where?</li>
        <li><strong>Resolve</strong> – Try a fix or recommend a solution using what you have available.</li>
        <li><strong>Elevate</strong> – If it worked, share it. If it needs help, raise it to someone who can assist.</li>
      </ul>
