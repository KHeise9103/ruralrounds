  <h2>The Needs of the Patient Come Last</h2>
  <div class="post-date">Posted July 31, 2025</div>
  <p>
    They told us, again and again, the needs of the patient come first.
  </p>
  <p>
    But it doesn't feel that way anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    What it feels like is that the needs of the patient come last - after the needs of the admin and physician egos and preferences, political maneuvers, branding strategies, cost-savings initiatives, and whatever hot new tech platform someone with a title wants to trial without understanding how care actually happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm burnt out. And not in the "I need a spa day" way. In the "I might have to leave a profession I loved because the system is actively hostile to the people trying to do the work" way.
  </p>
  <p>
    At some point, decisions stopped being made based on what actually helps patients or supports the people caring for them. Instead, they're made because someone in a suit (admin or physician) who hasn't touched an IV pump in a decade, if ever, thinks its a good idea - or worse, because it makes a good slide for some leadership summit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bedside staff raise concerns? Offer thoughtful, practical solutions? Ignored. Or worse, told they are "resistant to change" or "not strategic thinkers".
  </p>
  <p>
    It's maddening to watch the same broken workflows get polished up and rebranded with some corporate buzzwords while nothing improves for the people who are sick, scared, or dying - or those trying to care for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    We didn't go into healthcare for this.
  </p>
  <p>
    We went into it to help. To heal. But every year, we are fighting harder against our own system than we are for our patients.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know I'm not along. So if you're reading this and nodding, maybe its time we stop waiting for someone else to fix it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly they are not and will not.

  <h2>When It Hurts Anyway</h2>
  <div class="post-date">Posted July 5, 2025</div>
  <p>
    You did everything right. You gave the right meds, ran the code by the book, worked with the team like clockwork. You even managed to hold the daughter’s "hand" as she sobbed on the phone, 90 miles away and not making it in time.
  </p>
  <p>
    But sometimes, even when you do everything right, the outcome still hurts. And not just for the family—for you, too.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “You did the best you could with the information you had and the tools at your disposal.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It’s something we say to each other in the ED, in the ICU, in the quiet moments after we clean the room and before the next patient rolls in. Sometimes we say it out loud. Sometimes just in our heads, trying to believe it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rural medicine asks a lot of you. You don’t have a massive team to lean on. You may not have palliative care at the bedside or a chaplain on call. Sometimes it’s just you, a nurse, and the weight of the moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this has been your week—if you're carrying one of those losses—we see you. This work is sacred, even when it breaks your heart. Especially then.

      <h2>Lighting a FIRE for Frontline Innovation</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on July 2, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Some of the best ideas in healthcare don’t come from a whiteboard—they come from break rooms, bedside moments, and hallway huddles. But getting those ideas from spark to solution can feel nearly impossible without time, funding, or leadership buy-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where <strong>FIRE: Find, Identify, Resolve, Elevate</strong> comes in. FIRE is a lightweight, no-cost framework to empower anyone—nurses, techs, physicians, clerks—to surface and solve problems with what they already have: their voice and a willingness to improve.
      </p>
        <p>
        We created the <a href="fire.html">FIRE Playbook</a> to walk you through every step. From using a simple Google Form to collect ideas to tracking actions in a shared Sheet and looping in the right people via email—this guide is built for rural teams who need solutions without red tape.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Sometimes the right person just needs a nudge and a structure to make change possible. FIRE is about clearing the way for good ideas to get through.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you've ever said, "Someone should fix this," you’re exactly who FIRE is for. Check out the <a href="fire.html">FIRE Playbook</a> and see how you can help your team move from frustration to follow-through.

      <h2>“All I need is John”</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on June 24, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the most powerful moments in rural care come when nothing medical is needed. One of our nurses was helping an elderly woman and asked, “Is there anything you need?” Her reply: <em>“All I need is John.”</em> John, her husband, had been with her for decades—longer than most people have been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a reminder that connection, love, and memory are just as much a part of healing as any medication or monitor.

      <h2>Introducing SPARK: A Simple Framework for Acting on Safety Concerns</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on June 20, 2025</p>
      <p>
        In rural care, we often find ourselves solving problems in the moment with limited help and limited time. That’s why we created <strong>SPARK</strong>—a simple framework for surfacing and addressing small safety concerns before they become big ones.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>S</strong>pot a concern<br>
        <strong>P</strong>rioritize the issue<br>
        <strong>A</strong>ct with what you have<br>
        <strong>R</strong>eassess after action<br>
        <strong>K</strong>eep watch for recurrence
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        One of our nurses used SPARK when the portable suction unit wasn’t working. Instead of just fixing it and moving on, they sparked a discussion with the team and found that 3 of 5 units were overdue for service. Small action, big catch.
      </p>
      <p>
        SPARK gives us a way to talk about safety that doesn’t feel like reporting or blaming—it just feels like good care.
