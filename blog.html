      <h2>SPARK: The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
      <p><strong>Posted by Kate Â· June 30, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>
        We were two nurses on night shift, and the ER doc had just been called out for a trauma on the highway. Then the radio call came â€” a patient in respiratory distress was en route by private vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s when we used SPARK â€” Spot the red flags, Prioritize what matters most, Act on the top concern, Reassess constantly, and Keep Watch with the whole team. It helped us stay focused, calm, and connected, even when everything felt like it was moving too fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        We made this one-pager for teams like yours. Tape it on the wall, toss it in your clipboard, or share it with your next traveler. It's built from real rural moments â€” and meant for the ones who show up when it matters most.
