      <h2>Lighting a FIRE for Frontline Innovation</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on July 2, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Some of the best ideas in healthcare don’t come from a whiteboard—they come from break rooms, bedside moments, and hallway huddles. But getting those ideas from spark to solution can feel nearly impossible without time, funding, or leadership buy-in.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s where <strong>FIRE: Find, Identify, Resolve, Elevate</strong> comes in. FIRE is a lightweight, no-cost framework to empower anyone—nurses, techs, physicians, clerks—to surface and solve problems with what they already have: their voice and a willingness to improve.
      </p>
        <p>
        We created the <a href="fire.html">FIRE Playbook</a> to walk you through every step. From using a simple Google Form to collect ideas to tracking actions in a shared Sheet and looping in the right people via email—this guide is built for rural teams who need solutions without red tape.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Sometimes the right person just needs a nudge and a structure to make change possible. FIRE is about clearing the way for good ideas to get through.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        If you've ever said, "Someone should fix this," you’re exactly who FIRE is for. Check out the <a href="fire.html">FIRE Playbook</a> and see how you can help your team move from frustration to follow-through.

      <h2>“All I need is John”</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on June 24, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the most powerful moments in rural care come when nothing medical is needed. One of our nurses was helping an elderly woman and asked, “Is there anything you need?” Her reply: <em>“All I need is John.”</em> John, her husband, had been with her for decades—longer than most people have been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a reminder that connection, love, and memory are just as much a part of healing as any medication or monitor.

      <h2>Introducing SPARK: A Simple Framework for Acting on Safety Concerns</h2>
      <p class="post-date">Posted on June 20, 2025</p>
      <p>
        In rural care, we often find ourselves solving problems in the moment with limited help and limited time. That’s why we created <strong>SPARK</strong>—a simple framework for surfacing and addressing small safety concerns before they become big ones.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>S</strong>pot a concern<br>
        <strong>P</strong>rioritize the issue<br>
        <strong>A</strong>ct with what you have<br>
        <strong>R</strong>eassess after action<br>
        <strong>K</strong>eep watch for recurrence
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        One of our nurses used SPARK when the portable suction unit wasn’t working. Instead of just fixing it and moving on, they sparked a discussion with the team and found that 3 of 5 units were overdue for service. Small action, big catch.
      </p>
      <p>
        SPARK gives us a way to talk about safety that doesn’t feel like reporting or blaming—it just feels like good care.
