        <h2>“I Was the Only One There That Night”</h2>
        <p class="blog-meta"><em>By Anonymous | Posted June 30, 2025</em></p>

          It was 2:43 a.m. when the sheriff's office called. A rollover on Highway 14. I was the only nurse on call for the night at our 6-bed critical access hospital.
        </p>

          The paramedics were en route with a young man in his 20s, hypotensive and unresponsive. No CT. No trauma surgeon. Just me, a freshly trained EMT, and the knowledge that the nearest trauma center was 78 minutes away on dry roads.

          This wasn’t the first time I’d stood in a room and made decisions far above my pay grade. It won’t be the last. Rural medicine requires flexibility, intuition, and a whole lot of hope.

        <p><strong>This blog is a place to share these moments—big and small—and remind each other that we’re not alone out here.</strong></p>
