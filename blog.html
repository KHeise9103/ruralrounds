        <h2>A Simple Answer</h2>

          Sometimes the moments that stick with you the most aren’t medical at all.
          Last week, during rounds, I asked an elderly woman gently if she needed anything. Without missing a beat, she looked up and said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>“All I need is John.”</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          John, her husband of over 60 years, had been by her side for most of her life—and even now, in the hospital, that’s all she wanted.
          There was something incredibly tender and grounding in her words. In a world full of medications, monitors, and checklists,
          it was a simple reminder: the human connection still matters most.

          Not every story is dramatic. Some just warm your heart and remind you why you do this work.
